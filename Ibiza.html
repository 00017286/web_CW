              <td><span>All-Year Round Wonderful Weather <br></span>
                Ibiza has approximately 300 days of sunshine and blue skies. Summer is usually very hot - with temperatures reaching up to 35 degrees. Winter can get a bit chilly (especially at night) but temperatures rarely drop below 10 degrees - even if the high level of humanity with the absence of central heating in most of the houses, make the cold feel colder. The good weather stretches from March to November with some rain in Autumn, but usually it lasts just for couple of hours.</td>
              <td><span>Crowded in Summer <br></span>
                For as quiet as it is in the winter, Ibiza becomes a very busy island in summer. The municipalities of Playa d'en Bossa, San Antonio and Ibiza Town are probably the most affected ones with waves of holidaymakers flocking to the streets. But also smaller areas such as Portinatx, Es Canar or San José experience an increase in traffic and population. During summer, traffic jams are usually on the agenda, especially around Jesus-Ibiza Town and the Ca Na Negreta area and finding a parking space becomes a pretty difficult task.</td>

            <tr>
              <td><span>Many Beautiful Beaches <br></span>
                Considering it's such a tiny island, Ibiza has many beautiful wide beaches, sandy bays, private coves and rocky cliffs with access to the sea. Even if during summer, when most of the renowned beaches are besieged by tourists, there still some few spots where locals and visitors can enjoy some peace and quiet. But the best part is, out of season when even the most famous beaches can be blissfully deserted and residents can enjoy them.</td>
              <td><span>Language Barrier <br></span>
                If you want to relocate to Ibiza, you should learn Spanish first, at least a basic level. You can get by speaking your own language for a while - thanks to the wide established communities of Brits, Italian, Dutch, German, Latin American. But if you learn Spanish things will get much more easier, - if you speak Spanish you will get what you need faster, easier and probably cheaper.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span>Vivid Gastronomic Scene <br></span>
                Ibiza boasts many local markets where farmers sell theirs fruit & veg and in the last couple of years there has been seen an increase in opening of organic shops, which are now widely spread across the whole island. There are few chain supermarket and lately the opening of small specialised supermarket is being witnessed - which means that if you miss the food from your home-country, you can go there and buy the essentials to make your desired dinner. But the wide culinary offer of Ibiza does not stop there, in fact the island is home for many well-known multicultural restaurants - from five star dining experience to authentic Spanish restaurants, the choices are endless.</td>
                <td><span>Winter Limited Flights <br></span>
                In summer you have tons of direct flights from/to Ibiza, but in winter things get quieter, much quieter. Despite the fact that in the last couple of years there has been seen an increase in the number of winter flights connecting the island to main cities (London, Milan, Paris, Amsterdam and the mainland), there still a shortage of flights and most of the time it's necessary to stop first in Barcelona, Palma or Madrid.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span>Plenty of Outdoor Activities <br></span>
                Ibiza does not only offer beautiful turquoise sea and sandy beaches, but it provides also the perfect setting for biking, hiking, horse riding whilst enjoying breathtaking views and discovering the most authentic side of the island. If you like outdoor activities but don't want to do it by yourself, there are several residents groups which arrange tours and excursions, it's a good way to do some exercise, meet new people and discover the island!</td>
                <td><span>Winter Limited Availability of Public Transport <br></span>
                In the summer season public transport is available, with buses travelling all over the island, even to the beach! However, in winter much of the public transport is not available and unless you have your own transport, things can get very complicated.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span>Sense of Community <br></span>
                In summer the island is filled with tourists, but when they leave there is a very tight community, a very strong collective of cosmopolitan people. The island is so small that bumping into each other is a regular occurrence. People on the island are friendly, and many people are in the same boat; in terms of living away from their native country and friends and family - so making new friends will not be a problem.</td>
                <td><span>Island Time <br></span>
                First thing you should get used to is that there is no rush - be patient. It does take longer for things to happen, but eventually they happen. Also consider that on a working day, many offices, shops and stores close during the day for the siesta and they will open later on around 4 or 5pm. You can now plan your day in a more relaxed way.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span>Incredibly Safe Place <br></span>
                Crime on the island is very low, with it being pretty safe for women and kids to go out at night. There are few house break-ins and these tend to happen more often in summer, when the island gets busier - but overall there are no major incidents and in some part of the island, people are even still living without locking their doors every-time they leave the house.</td>
