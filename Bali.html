                    <p title="https://www.viceroybali.com/en/blog/bali-activities/balinese-culture/">There are over 20,000 Hindu temples in Bali (known as “pura”) - each with a specific function and rituality for the Balinese calendar year of 250 days. The different types of Balinese temples are arranged according to the physical and spiritual realm of Balinese Hinduism - from Pura Tirta “water temples” for cleansing rituals to Pura Segara “sea temples” that are located by the ocean to appease the sea Gods and deities. There are also village and family temples in Bali that are important parts of Balinese culture and traditions in that they provide places for the community to congregate and enjoy festivities.</p>

                    <p title="https://www.cookly.me/magazine/asia/indonesia/bali/10-foods-you-must-eat-in-bali-indonesia/">After a long day of exploring some of the best things to do in Bali, you'll probably be starving. Bali has certain foods that you can find in other parts of Indonesia but it can be very different. The main difference between Indonesian and Balinese food is the ingredients and spices that are used to prepare the dishes. There is a large population of Muslims in Indonesia but not in Bali. Since Muslims cannot eat pork, you will see more pork dishes in Bali.</p>

                    <h2>General</h2>
                    <p title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali">Bali is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.</p>

                    <h2>Language</h2>
                    <p title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_language">Balinese is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by 3.3 million people on the Indonesian island of Bali as well as Northern Nusa Penida, Western Lombok, Eastern Java, Southern Sumatra, and Sulawesi. Most Balinese speakers also know Indonesian. The Bali Cultural Agency estimated in 2011 that the number of people still using the Balinese language in their daily lives on the Bali Island is under 1 million. The language has been classified as "not endangered" by Glottolog. The higher registers of the language borrow extensively from Javanese: an old form of classical Javanese, Kawi, is used in Bali as a religious and ceremonial language.</p>
